All parts including the old 2 have now been confirmed to have valid tags in the English localization file. I count 194 part config files in the parts folder but only 190 parts in game when I type in SXT. It is not obvious what isn't turning up. The English localisation file has updated so that typing sxt and then a logical modifier will bring up specific parts, such as , cockpit,fuel,engine,wing,elevon,structur,electric,passenger,fuselage,cargo,science,rcs,rocket,jet,prop,probe,srb,dock,truck,nose,intake,adapter etc.
The following parts now have new textures of their own.
Gnat SRB, Kickback SRB, Tycho Anomaly, Senior Docking Port, RCS boom, RCS rack, Dontstayputnik.
Please work from the config files I am sending you because some have repairs and others edits for the new textures.
All have some small amount of tidying.
